        <p> The Coastal candies is a business owned by Onywera Achieng Magret as the sole owner.
            It was started in 2018 locally in Kisumu. In 2022 around January, I saw it fit to officially 
            start  this business online in order to acquire and get more demand and make better sales.
            I had no background on IT, so i decided to apply for a bootcamp at LakeHub Academy, i got a chance
            and was among the chosen few. I did coding for six months, and i decided to create my own website
            for people to get to know about my business and my products to sell. 
            Every step counts, every journey begins with the first step.
            Every opportunity counts, no matter how little and effortless it might seem.
